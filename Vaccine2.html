          <p class="lead">In India <strong>COVID Vaccine</strong> eligibility is determined by the latest guidelines from the Health Ministry. As of June 21, 2021, all adults above the age of 18 are eligible to receive the COVID vaccine, provided they are not allergic to any of the ingredients in the vaccine.</p>

          <p class="lead">At CoviCare, we will be offering all ICMR-cleared COVID vaccine options.</p>
          <p>Covishield is a recombinant, replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vector encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein. Following administration, the genetic material of part of corona virus is expressed which stimulates an immune response. The Indian government has recommended that the time interval between the 1st and 2nd dose should be between 12-16 weeks. </p>
          
          <p>COVAXIN® is included along with immune-potentiators, also known as vaccine adjuvants, which are added to the vaccine to increase and boost its immunogenicity.It is a 2-dose vaccination regimen given 28 days apart.</p>
          
          <p>Both vaccines help the body develop an immunity to the virus that causes COVID, <em>without having to get the illness</em>. In the weeks after the initial dose, the body begins to recognize the illness and prepare to fight it. The second dose ramps up the development of helpful lymphocytes that fight off the virus should you be exposed. Both doses are essential to make sure the vaccine is effective.</p>

              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you get your COVID vaccine in , there are a few things you can do to prepare and educate yourself about the process. Two of them you have &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;already done; checking to see if you are eligible and learning about the different vaccines available.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing to do is be prepared before you arrive. Start by checking for free slots and making a reservation for your vaccination.</p>

              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you arrive at the Vaccination Center, be sure to wear your mask and keep it on for the duration of your appointment. Maintain proper social &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distancing (6 feet, wearing a mask) during your visit. Immediately following your vaccination, you will be monitored for any allergic reactions.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will also receive a fact sheet on the vaccine you received, as well as a card indicating the type of vaccine you received and the date, time, and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;location of where you received it. Keep these for your records.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending on which vaccine you receive, you may need a second dose. If that is the case, you will schedule a follow-up appointment for your second &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dose, where you will repeat the above steps.</p>

                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you have completed receiving your vaccine, it will still take between two to three weeks to become effective, depending on the type of vaccine &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you receive. It is important to allow the vaccine to properly activate your immune system before thinking that you are “immune” to COVID.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even then, there are studies showing that people who receive the COVID vaccine can still be carriers. It is important to maintain proper social &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distancing and mask procedures even after you have received the vaccine, to protect others who have not yet been vaccinated. However, once your &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vaccine has had time to properly activate your immune system, you should have a 95% chance to avoid catching the virus.</p>
